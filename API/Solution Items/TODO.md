[X] Create Tours Repository
[X] Create Tours Service
[X] Create Tours Controller
[X] Create Booking Repository
[X] Create Booking Service
[X] Create Booking Controller

[X] Need User to relate to Booking
[X] Seed Tours database
[X] Change Service/Repository "Add" into "Create" for consistency
[X] IMPORTANT!! I need to link User with Bookings

[ ] Seats available need to adjust


LATER:
[X] Passenger should be able to buy more than one seat
[ ] Each seat will need additional passenger information
[ ] Booking Services will need to book {x} amount of seats.


6/12/2025:
[ ] If flight is booked, dropdown doesn't display seats which is good, but it needs to provide a message.
[X] Cancel button on 'Book now' doesn't work
[ ] If you go to Book Tours and try to 'Book' tour, it sends you to login but doesn't redirect you back. (Should go back to /Tours)
[ ] Login needs a link to /Register
[ ] I don't need to use ImageUrl in CART. I can pull it from tourservice.
